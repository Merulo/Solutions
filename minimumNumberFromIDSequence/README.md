Given a pattern containing I's and D's find minimum number following that pattern.
Digits must be unique.
There first number has no constraints.
The next numbers must be I(ncreased) or D(ecreased) based on the previous one.
Examples:

""          = 1
"I"         = 12
"D"         = 21
"ID"        = 132
"II"        = 123
"DD"        = 321
"DI"        = 213
"IIDDII"    = 1254367
"DDIIDD"    = 3214765
"DIDDIDD"   = 21543876
